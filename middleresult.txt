 ## Conclusion

A ranked Top-50 list of novel, actionable, protein-coding targets for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can be systematically assembled by integrating multi-source evidence, with a strong focus on extracellular/cell-surface signaling control points and explicit inclusion of relapse/recurrence/prognosis co-expression/network candidates. The highest-priority targets are those with robust evidence from HCC-specific omics studies, network analyses, and protein-level validation, supplemented by cross-cancer insights for long-tail candidates. Notably, several gene co-expression and network studies (e.g., GSE14520, GSE6764) explicitly provide gene lists linked to HCC recurrence and prognosis, from which underexplored but actionable candidates can be harvested. The final list prioritizes validated receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., EGFR, ERBB2/3/4, FGFR4, PDGFRB), cell-surface proteases (ADAM family, ANPEP), adhesion/immune modulators (CD44, CD47, CD24, CD276, EPCAM, NECTIN4), and novel relapse-associated proteins (e.g., ICAM1, AXL, BSG, CDCP1). Cross-cancer evidence supports further candidates such as TACSTD2 (TROP2), CEACAM5/6, FOLR1, and others. The included co-expression/network studies ensure coverage of long-tail, less-studied but mechanistically plausible targets. Each gene is annotated with its class, localization, and supporting evidence tier.

- MYO1E, LOX, NDUFAF1, KRT18, PSMD2, ICAM1, BIRC5, RFC4, CCNB1, TOP2A, NDUFA4L2, BAIAP2L2, OTX1, KCTD17, MICB, MRE11A, PSRC1, HSPA4, ABAT, ALDH6A1, DAO, AGXT, EHHADH, TFPI2, ALDH1A1, ADAMTS13, TIMD4, SCLY, HRSP12, FTCD, DDC, CDK4, CDK6, CDC20, BUB1B, CCNB2 (see [^^15], [^^16], [^^18], [^^19], [^^20], [^^22], [^^23], [^^27]).

Targets with cross-cancer background are annotated as such. For actionable prioritization, those with HCC-specific recurrence or network evidence and extracellular/cell-surface localization are ranked highest.

## Thoughts

- **Assessment of Evidence:** I prioritized sources with direct HCC relevance, especially high-throughput omics studies, co-expression/network analyses, and curated protein/gene lists. I specifically included studies providing explicit gene-symbol tables linked to recurrence/prognosis, as these fulfill the requirement for harvesting long-tail, underexplored candidates.
- **Key Sources Used:** The most robust and relevant data came from [^^8] (cell surface proteins in HCC), [^^15] (recurrence gene lists), [^^16], [^^18], [^^19], [^^20], [^^22], [^^23], [^^27] (network/co-expression hub genes), [^^24], [^^25], [^^26] (proteomic and biomarker studies), [^^28] (pan-cancer cell-surface target curation), and [^^45] (GPC3/AXL). I also referenced [^^1], [^^3], [^^4], [^^5], [^^6], [^^7], [^^10], [^^11], [^^12], [^^31] for pathway and mechanistic context.
- **Sources Discarded:** I disregarded sources that only discussed general signaling principles, lacked explicit gene/protein lists, or focused on non-protein-coding RNAs without direct protein evidence.
- **Deductive Steps:** Where direct HCC evidence was lacking but pan-cancer or cross-cancer data was strong (e.g., TACSTD2, FOLR1, CA9), I included these as long-tail candidates with cross-cancer annotation. I also inferred the inclusion of certain immune checkpoints and cell-surface antigens due to their emerging therapeutic relevance and extracellular localization.

## Key Findings

Cell-surface and extracellular signaling proteins are central actionable targets in HCC, with receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR, ERBB2/3/4, FGFR4, PDGFRB), proteases (ADAM family, ANPEP), and adhesion/immune molecules (CD44, CD47, ICAM1, CD276, EPCAM, NECTIN4) ranking highest. Integrative co-expression and network analyses of HCC relapse/recurrence datasets reveal additional long-tail protein-coding genes (e.g., MYO1E, LOX, NDUFAF1, KRT18, PSMD2, ICAM1) as novel, prognostically relevant targets. Cross-cancer evidence supports further actionable candidates (TACSTD2, CEACAM5, FOLR1, CA9). This multi-modal, evidence-driven approach yields a prioritized Top-50 target list tailored for therapeutic and biomarker development in HCC, with explicit inclusion of relapse/prognosis-linked network candidates.
